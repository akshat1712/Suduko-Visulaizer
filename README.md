# Suduko-Visulaizer
A GUI to demonstrate the solving of Sudoku  

The algorithm I have used is the standard Backtracking algorithm used to solve sudoku problems.  

In the Video , I have solved the so called hardest sudoku in the world , link to quora answer: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-toughest-sudoku-in-world . The time taken to  solve was approximately 1 minutes.  
I have also solved when nothing is there in the sudoku, hence we got answer ASAP.

Do let me know if you have any better idea for UI / UX .  

Fun Fact- Sudoku solving is a NP hard problem and also it is claimed a sudoku with less than 17 digits filled does have a unique answer.
