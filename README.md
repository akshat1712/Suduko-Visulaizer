# Suduko-Visulaizer
A GUI to demonstrate the solving of Sudoku  

The algorithm I have used is the standard Backtracking algorithm used to solve sudoku problems.  

In the Video , I have solved the so called hardest sudoku in the world , link to quora answer: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-toughest-sudoku-in-world . The time taken to  solve was approximately 1 minutes.  
I have also solved when nothing is there in the sudoku, hence we got answer ASAP.

P.S : I am still working to make GUI much better than current one
